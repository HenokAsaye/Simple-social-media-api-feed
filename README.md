# Social Media Feed API

This is a RESTful API for a social media platform where users can post updates, like and comment on posts, follow/unfollow other users, and receive notifications for likes and comments. The API manages relationships between users and provides a personalized feed of posts from users they follow.

## Features
- **Create, Edit, and Delete Posts**: Users can create, update, and delete posts.
- **Like and Comment**: Users can like and comment on posts.
- **Follow/Unfollow Users**: Users can follow or unfollow other users and view their posts in the feed.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when their posts are liked or commented on.
- **Personalized Feed**: A feed of posts from followed users is generated for each user.

## Technologies
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** 
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Socket.io** (for real-time notifications)
- **Mongoose/Sequelize ORM** (for managing database relationships)
- **Redis** (for caching feeds, optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-feed-api.git
   cd social-media-feed-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:
     ```
     PORT=5000
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     REDIS_URL=<your-redis-url> # Optional
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

You can use Postman or any API client to interact with the following endpoints. Make sure to include the JWT token for authentication where necessary.

## Endpoints

### Posts
- **Create a Post**
  ```http
  POST /api/posts
  ```
  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "content": "This is my new post!",
    "image": "<optional image URL>"
  }
  ```

- **Edit a Post**
  ```http
  PUT /api/posts/:postId
  ```

- **Delete a Post**
  ```http
  DELETE /api/posts/:postId
  ```

- **Get Feed (Posts from followed users)**
  ```http
  GET /api/feed
  ```

### Likes
- **Like a Post**
  ```http
  POST /api/posts/:postId/like
  ```

- **Unlike a Post**
  ```http
  DELETE /api/posts/:postId/like
  ```

### Comments
- **Add a Comment**
  ```http
  POST /api/posts/:postId/comment
  ```
  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "comment": "Great post!"
  }
  ```

- **Delete a Comment**
  ```http
  DELETE /api/posts/:postId/comment/:commentId
  ```

### User Relationships
- **Follow a User**
  ```http
  POST /api/users/:userId/follow
  ```

- **Unfollow a User**
  ```http
  DELETE /api/users/:userId/follow
  ```

- **Get User's Followers**
  ```http
  GET /api/users/:userId/followers
  ```

- **Get User's Following**
  ```http
  GET /api/users/:userId/following
  ```

### Notifications
- **Get Notifications**
  ```http
  GET /api/notifications
  ```

## Feed Algorithm

The feed is generated by retrieving posts from users that the authenticated user follows. Posts are sorted by timestamp (newest first) and may include a ranking system based on engagement (likes/comments) in future iterations.

Caching can be implemented with **Redis** for better performance, especially when handling a large number of posts.

## Real-time Notifications

Real-time notifications are powered by **Socket.io**, allowing users to receive instant updates when:
- Their post is liked.
- Someone comments on their post.

## Learning Outcomes

This project will help you understand the following concepts:
1. **Feed Algorithms**: Learn how to build and optimize a social media feed based on user relationships and post engagement.
2. **User Relationships**: Manage followers/following relationships and their impact on the feed.
3. **Real-time Features**: Implement real-time updates using **Socket.io** for notifications.
4. **Data Management**: Learn how to manage complex data relationships between users, posts, comments, likes, and notifications using databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
