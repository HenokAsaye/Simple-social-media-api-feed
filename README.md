## Features
- **Create, Edit, and Delete Posts**: Users can create, update, and delete posts.
- **Like and Comment**: Users can like and comment on posts.
- **Follow/Unfollow Users**: Users can follow or unfollow other users and view their posts in the feed.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when their posts are liked or commented on.
- **Personalized Feed**: A feed of posts from followed users is generated for each user.

## Technologies
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** 
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Socket.io** (for real-time notifications)
- **Mongoose/Sequelize ORM** (for managing database relationships)
- **Redis** (for caching feeds, optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HenokAsaye/social-media-feed-api.git
   cd social-media-feed-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

You can use Postman or any API client to interact with the following endpoints. Make sure to include the JWT token for authentication where necessary.

## Endpoints

### Posts
- **Create a Post**
  ```http
  POST /post
  ```
  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "content": "This is my new post!",
    "image": "<optional image URL>"
  }
  ```

- **Edit a Post**
  ```http
  PATCH /post/:postId
  ```

- **Delete a Post**
  ```http
  DELETE /post/:postId
  ```

### Likes
- **Like a Post**
  ```http
  POST /LIKE/:postId
  ```

- **Unlike a Post**
  ```http
  DELETE /like/:postId/like
  ```

### Comments
- **Add a Comment**
  ```http
  POST /comment/:postId
  ```
  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "comment": "Great post!"
  }
  ```

- **Delete a Comment**
  ```http
  DELETE /comment/:postId
  ```

### User Relationships
- **Follow a User**
  ```http
  POST /user
  ```

- **Unfollow a User**
  ```http
  DELETE /user
  ```

- **Get User's Followers**
  ```http
  GET /user
  ```

- **Get  Following posts**
  ```http
  GET / post/getffPost
  ```

### Notifications
- **Get Notifications**
  ```http
  GET /notification
  ```

## Feed Algorithm

The feed is generated by retrieving posts from users that the authenticated user follows. Posts are sorted by timestamp (newest first) and may include a ranking system based on engagement (likes/comments) in future iterations.

Caching can be implemented with **Redis** for better performance, especially when handling a large number of posts.

## Real-time Notifications

Real-time notifications are powered by **Socket.io**, allowing users to receive instant updates when:
- Their post is liked.
- Someone comments on their post.

## Learning Outcomes

This project will help you understand the following concepts:
1. **Feed Algorithms**: Learn how to build and optimize a social media feed based on user relationships and post engagement.
2. **User Relationships**: Manage followers/following relationships and their impact on the feed.
3. **Real-time Features**: Implement real-time updates using **Socket.io** for notifications.
4. **Data Management**: Learn how to manage complex data relationships between users, posts, comments, likes, and notifications using databases like MongoDB.



You can customize it further based on the specific technologies and features you want to add.
